# Guitar Pedal PCB Design

A custom guitar gain pedal designed from scratch, including schematic, breadboard validation, and full PCB layout. This project uses a TL082 op-amp and demonstrates analog design, PCB layout, and audio electronics.

## Overview
This project began as an independent electronics study. I designed, breadboarded, and fabricated a working gain pedal. The PCB was created in KiCad and checked using DRC.

## Tools and Skills
- KiCad (schematic + PCB)
- Breadboarding and soldering
- TL082 op-amp analysis
- Audio circuit design


## Key Contributions
- Designed the full schematic and verified functionality on a breadboard.
- Created a custom PCB layout and performed all routing.
- Ran DRC checks and updated the design for manufacturability.
- Tested output signals using oscilloscope sine-wave injection.
